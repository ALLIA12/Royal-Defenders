# Royal Defenders 
This project is a video game called Royal Defenders, which is a Tower Defense Game (TDG). The main goal of the game is to defend a kingdom from waves of enemy attackers using various towers. The player can build these towers and upgrade them to improve their effectiveness. The game also includes three different pathfinding algorithms that the enemies use to navigate the game world: Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, and A* Search. The game was developed using the Unity game engine and follows the Sprint methodology. The game includes a main menu, settings menu, level select menu, in-game interface, and pause menu. The project aims to compare the performance of different pathfinding algorithms and determine which is the most effective in the context of a TDG.
# Availability
